# Database Types

In the world of data management, databases are categorized into various types based on their structure, functionality, and the way they store and retrieve data. Understanding these types is crucial for selecting the right database for specific applications and use cases. This document will explore the two primary categories of databases: relational and non-relational.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are structured to recognize relations among stored items of information. They use a schema to define the structure of the data, which is organized into tables (also known as relations). Each table consists of rows and columns, where:

- **Rows** represent individual records.
- **Columns** represent attributes of the records.

### Key Features of Relational Databases:
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: Relational databases use SQL for querying and managing data.
- **Data Integrity**: They enforce data integrity through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.
- **ACID Compliance**: Relational databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions.

### Examples of Relational Databases:
- Oracle Database
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL

## Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They do not require a fixed schema and can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.

### Key Features of Non-Relational Databases:
- **Flexibility**: They allow for dynamic schemas, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements.
- **Scalability**: Non-relational databases are often designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers.
- **High Performance**: They can provide faster data retrieval and write operations, especially for large volumes of data.

### Examples of Non-Relational Databases:
- MongoDB (Document Store)
- Cassandra (Wide-Column Store)
- Redis (Key-Value Store)
- Neo4j (Graph Database)

## Conclusion

Choosing between a relational and a non-relational database depends on the specific needs of the application, including data structure, scalability requirements, and the complexity of queries. Understanding the differences between these types of databases is essential for effective data management and application development.
