### **4. Mock Exam Questions**

#### **SQL Certification Sample Questions:**
```sql
-- Question 1: Which query correctly finds employees hired in the last 30 days?
-- A) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date > SYSDATE - 30;
-- B) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1);
-- C) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date > ADD_DAYS(SYSDATE, -30);
-- D) SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date >= SYSDATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY;

-- Answer: D

-- Question 2: What is the result of this query?
SELECT 
    department_id,
    COUNT(*) as emp_count,
    AVG(salary) as avg_sal
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;

-- A) All departments with their employee counts and average salaries
-- B) Only departments with more than 5 employees, ordered by average salary
-- C) All departments ordered by average salary descending
-- D) Only departments with average salary greater than 5

-- Answer: B

-- Question 3: Which statement about ROWNUM is correct?
-- A) ROWNUM is assigned after ORDER BY is processed
-- B) ROWNUM can be used in UPDATE statements
-- C) ROWNUM is assigned before WHERE clause is processed
-- D) ROWNUM values are persistent across queries

-- Answer: C
```

#### **PL/SQL Certification Sample Questions:**
```sql
-- Question 1: What happens when this code executes?
DECLARE
    v_count NUMBER;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM employees WHERE department_id = 999;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Count: ' || v_count);
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No data found');
END;
/

-- A) Prints "No data found"
-- B) Prints "Count: 0"
-- C) Raises an unhandled exception
-- D) Compilation error

-- Answer: B (COUNT(*) always returns a value, even if 0)

-- Question 2: Which cursor attribute is used to check if a cursor is open?
-- A) %FOUND
-- B) %NOTFOUND
-- C) %ISOPEN
-- D) %ROWCOUNT

-- Answer: C

-- Question 3: What is the correct way to handle multiple exceptions?
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        -- Handle no data
    WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
        -- Handle multiple rows
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Handle any other exception

-- A) This is correct
-- B) OTHERS must come before specific exceptions
-- C) You can only have one exception handler
-- D) Each exception needs its own block
