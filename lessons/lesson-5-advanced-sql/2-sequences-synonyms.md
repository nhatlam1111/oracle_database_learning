## Understanding Sequences

### What is a Sequence?

A **sequence** is a database object that generates unique numbers automatically. Sequences are commonly used for:

- **Primary Key Values**: Auto-incrementing IDs
- **Transaction Numbers**: Unique transaction identifiers
- **Version Numbers**: Document or record versioning
- **Batch Numbers**: Processing batch identification

### Key Features of Sequences

#### **Guaranteed Uniqueness**
```sql
-- Each call to NEXTVAL returns a unique number
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;  -- Returns 1
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;  -- Returns 2
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;  -- Returns 3
```

#### **Performance Optimization**
- Numbers are pre-allocated in memory
- No locking required for number generation
- High concurrency support

#### **Flexibility**
- Configurable increment values
- Start values and maximum values
- Cycling and caching options

### Sequence vs Alternative Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Sequences** | Fast, concurrent, guaranteed unique | Oracle-specific, gaps possible |
| **MAX(ID)+1** | Simple, no gaps | Slow, locking issues, not concurrent |
| **Application Logic** | Portable | Complex, prone to errors |
| **UUID/GUID** | Globally unique | Large storage, not sequential |

## Creating and Managing Sequences

### Basic Sequence Creation

#### Simple Sequence
```sql
-- Create a basic sequence starting at 1
CREATE SEQUENCE employee_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1;

-- Use the sequence
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;  -- Gets next value
SELECT employee_seq.CURRVAL FROM dual;  -- Gets current value (after NEXTVAL)
```

#### Sequence with All Options
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE order_seq
    START WITH 1000          -- Start at 1000
    INCREMENT BY 1           -- Increment by 1
    MAXVALUE 999999         -- Maximum value
    MINVALUE 1              -- Minimum value (for cycling)
    NOCYCLE                 -- Don't cycle when max reached
    CACHE 20                -- Cache 20 values in memory
    NOORDER;                -- Don't guarantee order in RAC
```

### Sequence Parameters Explained

#### **START WITH**
```sql
-- Start sequence at specific value
CREATE SEQUENCE invoice_seq START WITH 10000;
-- First value will be 10000
```

#### **INCREMENT BY**
```sql
-- Increment by different amounts
CREATE SEQUENCE even_seq INCREMENT BY 2;        -- 2, 4, 6, 8...
CREATE SEQUENCE negative_seq INCREMENT BY -1;   -- Countdown sequence
```

#### **MAXVALUE and MINVALUE**
```sql
-- Set bounds
CREATE SEQUENCE bounded_seq
    START WITH 1
    MAXVALUE 1000
    MINVALUE 1;
```

#### **CYCLE vs NOCYCLE**
```sql
-- Cycling sequence (returns to start after max)
CREATE SEQUENCE cycling_seq
    START WITH 1
    MAXVALUE 100
    CYCLE;

-- After reaching 100, next value will be 1 again
```

#### **CACHE**
```sql
-- Cache for performance
CREATE SEQUENCE high_volume_seq
    CACHE 100;              -- Pre-allocate 100 numbers

CREATE SEQUENCE low_volume_seq
    NOCACHE;                -- Generate one at a time
```

#### **ORDER vs NOORDER**
```sql
-- Important for Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters)
CREATE SEQUENCE rac_seq ORDER;      -- Guarantee order across nodes (slower)
CREATE SEQUENCE rac_seq NOORDER;    -- No order guarantee (faster)
```

### Modifying Sequences

```sql
-- Alter sequence parameters
ALTER SEQUENCE employee_seq
    INCREMENT BY 5
    MAXVALUE 100000
    CACHE 50;

-- Cannot modify START WITH value
-- Must drop and recreate to change START WITH
```

### Sequence Information

```sql
-- View sequence details
SELECT sequence_name, min_value, max_value, increment_by, 
       last_number, cache_size, cycle_flag
FROM user_sequences
WHERE sequence_name = 'EMPLOYEE_SEQ';

-- Check all sequences
SELECT sequence_name, last_number, cache_size
FROM user_sequences
ORDER BY sequence_name;
```

---

## Sequence Usage Patterns

### Primary Key Generation

#### **Method 1: Direct in INSERT**
```sql
-- Create table with sequence-generated primary key
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100),
    created_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

-- Create sequence for primary key
CREATE SEQUENCE customer_seq START WITH 1;

-- Insert using sequence
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email)
VALUES (customer_seq.NEXTVAL, 'John Doe', 'john@email.com');

INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email)
VALUES (customer_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Jane Smith', 'jane@email.com');
```

#### **Method 2: Using Triggers (Oracle 11g and earlier)**
```sql
-- Create trigger for automatic ID assignment
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER customers_pk_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT ON customers
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.customer_id IS NULL THEN
        :NEW.customer_id := customer_seq.NEXTVAL;
    END IF;
END;

-- Now you can insert without specifying ID
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, email)
VALUES ('Bob Johnson', 'bob@email.com');
```

#### **Method 3: Identity Columns (Oracle 12c+)**
```sql
-- Modern approach with identity columns
CREATE TABLE modern_customers (
    customer_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    customer_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100),
    created_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

-- Insert without specifying ID
INSERT INTO modern_customers (customer_name, email)
VALUES ('Alice Brown', 'alice@email.com');
```

### Multi-Table Sequences

```sql
-- Shared sequence across related tables
CREATE SEQUENCE transaction_seq START WITH 1;

-- Orders table
INSERT INTO sales.orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date)
VALUES (transaction_seq.NEXTVAL, 1, SYSDATE);

-- Payments table (using same sequence for consistency)
INSERT INTO payments (payment_id, order_id, amount)
VALUES (transaction_seq.NEXTVAL, 1, 150.00);
```

### Sequence Reset and Maintenance

```sql
-- Function to reset sequence to specific value
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reset_sequence(
    seq_name VARCHAR2,
    new_value NUMBER
) RETURN NUMBER IS
    current_val NUMBER;
    increment_val NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Get current value
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT ' || seq_name || '.NEXTVAL FROM dual' INTO current_val;
    
    -- Calculate increment needed
    increment_val := new_value - current_val - 1;
    
    -- Alter sequence
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SEQUENCE ' || seq_name || ' INCREMENT BY ' || increment_val;
    
    -- Get next value (which will be the desired value)
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT ' || seq_name || '.NEXTVAL FROM dual' INTO current_val;
    
    -- Reset increment to 1
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SEQUENCE ' || seq_name || ' INCREMENT BY 1';
    
    RETURN current_val;
END;

-- Usage
SELECT reset_sequence('customer_seq', 5000) FROM dual;
```

### Handling Sequence Gaps

```sql
-- Sequences may have gaps due to:
-- 1. Rollbacks
-- 2. System crashes  
-- 3. Cached values not used

-- Example of gap creation
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name)
    VALUES (customer_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Test Customer');
    
    -- This rollback creates a gap
    ROLLBACK;
END;

-- Next insert will skip the rolled-back number
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name)
VALUES (customer_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Real Customer');

-- Check for gaps
SELECT customer_id, 
       LAG(customer_id) OVER (ORDER BY customer_id) as prev_id,
       customer_id - LAG(customer_id) OVER (ORDER BY customer_id) as gap
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id - LAG(customer_id) OVER (ORDER BY customer_id) > 1
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

## Understanding Synonyms

### What is a Synonym?

A **synonym** is an alias for a database object (table, view, sequence, procedure, etc.). Synonyms provide:

- **Location Transparency**: Hide object location from users
- **Security**: Control access through synonym permissions
- **Portability**: Change underlying objects without changing code
- **Simplification**: Shorter names for complex object paths

### Types of Synonyms

#### **Private Synonyms**
- Owned by a specific user
- Only accessible to that user (unless granted)
- Created in user's schema

#### **Public Synonyms**
- Available to all database users
- Created by privileged users (DBA)
- No schema qualification needed

### Benefits of Synonyms

#### **Code Portability**
```sql
-- Without synonyms - environment-specific code
SELECT * FROM prod_schema.employees;      -- Production
SELECT * FROM test_schema.employees;      -- Test
SELECT * FROM dev_schema.employees;       -- Development

-- With synonyms - environment-independent code
CREATE SYNONYM employees FOR prod_schema.employees;  -- Production
CREATE SYNONYM employees FOR test_schema.employees;  -- Test  
CREATE SYNONYM employees FOR dev_schema.employees;   -- Development

-- Same code works in all environments
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

#### **Simplified Access**
```sql
-- Complex object name
SELECT * FROM hr_application.employee_management.current_employees_view;

-- Create synonym for simplification
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR hr_application.employee_management.current_employees_view;

-- Simplified access
SELECT * FROM emp;
```

---

## Creating and Managing Synonyms

### Creating Private Synonyms

```sql
-- Basic private synonym
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;

-- Synonym for object in different schema
CREATE SYNONYM sales_data FOR sales_schema.orders;

-- Synonym for complex object
CREATE SYNONYM monthly_sales FOR reporting.monthly_sales_materialized_view;
```

### Creating Public Synonyms

```sql
-- Create public synonym (requires DBA privileges)
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM global_employees FOR hr.employees;

-- Now all users can access without schema qualification
SELECT * FROM global_employees;
```

### Synonym for Different Object Types

#### **Table Synonyms**
```sql
CREATE SYNONYM cust FOR customers;
CREATE SYNONYM prod FOR sales.products;
```

#### **View Synonyms**
```sql
CREATE SYNONYM emp_summary FOR employee_department_summary;
CREATE SYNONYM sales_rpt FOR monthly_sales_report_view;
```

#### **Sequence Synonyms**
```sql
CREATE SYNONYM next_id FOR customer_seq;

-- Usage
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name)
VALUES (next_id.NEXTVAL, 'New Customer');
```

#### **Procedure/Function Synonyms**
```sql
CREATE SYNONYM calc_bonus FOR hr.calculate_employee_bonus;

-- Usage
EXEC calc_bonus(employee_id => 100);
```

### Managing Synonyms

#### **View Synonym Information**
```sql
-- Check user's private synonyms
SELECT synonym_name, table_owner, table_name
FROM user_synonyms
ORDER BY synonym_name;

-- Check all synonyms accessible to user
SELECT owner, synonym_name, table_owner, table_name
FROM all_synonyms
WHERE synonym_name LIKE 'EMP%'
ORDER BY owner, synonym_name;

-- Check public synonyms
SELECT synonym_name, table_owner, table_name
FROM dba_synonyms
WHERE owner = 'PUBLIC'
ORDER BY synonym_name;
```

#### **Dropping Synonyms**
```sql
-- Drop private synonym
DROP SYNONYM emp;

-- Drop public synonym (requires DBA privileges)
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM global_employees;
```

#### **Replace Synonyms**
```sql
-- Replace synonym with OR REPLACE
CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM emp FOR new_employees_table;

-- Synonyms don't support OR REPLACE, so drop first
DROP SYNONYM emp;
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR new_employees_table;
```

---

## Advanced Object Management

### Database Links with Synonyms

```sql
-- Create database link to remote database
CREATE DATABASE LINK remote_db
CONNECT TO hr_user IDENTIFIED BY password
USING 'remote_server';

-- Create synonym for remote table
CREATE SYNONYM remote_employees FOR employees@remote_db;

-- Access remote data transparently
SELECT * FROM remote_employees WHERE department_id = 20;
```

### Schema Migration with Synonyms

```sql
-- Original application points to old schema
-- CREATE SYNONYM app_employees FOR old_schema.employees;

-- Phase 1: Create synonyms pointing to old schema
CREATE SYNONYM app_employees FOR old_schema.employees;
CREATE SYNONYM app_departments FOR old_schema.departments;

-- Phase 2: Migrate data to new schema
-- (Data migration process)

-- Phase 3: Switch synonyms to new schema
DROP SYNONYM app_employees;
CREATE SYNONYM app_employees FOR new_schema.employees;

DROP SYNONYM app_departments;
CREATE SYNONYM app_departments FOR new_schema.departments;

-- Application code remains unchanged!
```

### Multi-Environment Setup

```sql
-- Development environment setup
CREATE SYNONYM config_table FOR dev_config.application_config;
CREATE SYNONYM log_table FOR dev_logs.application_logs;

-- Production environment setup
-- CREATE SYNONYM config_table FOR prod_config.application_config;
-- CREATE SYNONYM log_table FOR prod_logs.application_logs;

-- Same application code works in both environments
SELECT config_value FROM config_table WHERE config_name = 'MAX_USERS';
INSERT INTO log_table (log_message, log_date) VALUES ('User login', SYSDATE);
```

### Sequence and Synonym Integration

```sql
-- Create sequence in specific schema
CREATE SEQUENCE hr.employee_id_seq START WITH 1000;

-- Create public synonym for the sequence
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_id_seq FOR hr.employee_id_seq;

-- Application uses synonym
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (emp_id_seq.NEXTVAL, 'John', 'Doe');

-- Easy to change sequence location later
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_id_seq;
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_id_seq FOR new_hr.employee_id_seq;
```

## Best Practices

### Sequence Best Practices

#### **1. Naming Conventions**
```sql
-- Good naming conventions
CREATE SEQUENCE customer_seq;          -- Clear purpose
CREATE SEQUENCE order_id_seq;          -- Specific to use case
CREATE SEQUENCE transaction_number_seq; -- Descriptive

-- Poor naming
CREATE SEQUENCE seq1;                  -- Unclear
CREATE SEQUENCE s_cust;               -- Too abbreviated
```

#### **2. Appropriate Cache Sizes**
```sql
-- High-volume sequences
CREATE SEQUENCE order_seq CACHE 100;   -- Frequent inserts

-- Low-volume sequences  
CREATE SEQUENCE config_seq CACHE 5;    -- Infrequent inserts

-- Single-user sequences
CREATE SEQUENCE user_pref_seq NOCACHE; -- One user, no caching needed
```

#### **3. Monitoring and Maintenance**
```sql
-- Monitor sequence usage
SELECT 
    sequence_name,
    last_number,
    cache_size,
    CASE WHEN max_value - last_number < cache_size * 10 
         THEN 'WARNING: Approaching max value'
         ELSE 'OK'
    END as status
FROM user_sequences;

-- Regular sequence health check
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE check_sequence_health IS
    v_warning_threshold NUMBER := 1000;
BEGIN
    FOR seq_rec IN (
        SELECT sequence_name, max_value, last_number
        FROM user_sequences
        WHERE max_value - last_number < v_warning_threshold
    ) LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('WARNING: Sequence ' || seq_rec.sequence_name || 
                           ' is approaching maximum value');
    END LOOP;
END;
```

### Synonym Best Practices

#### **1. Clear Naming Strategy**
```sql
-- Good synonym names
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;              -- Clear abbreviation
CREATE SYNONYM monthly_rpt FOR monthly_report_view; -- Descriptive

-- Avoid confusing names
-- CREATE SYNONYM data FOR employees;          -- Too generic
-- CREATE SYNONYM e FOR employees;             -- Too short
```

#### **2. Documentation**
```sql
-- Document synonym purposes
-- Synonym: emp_data
-- Purpose: Points to current employee table, may change during migrations
-- Created: 2025-01-15
-- Owner: HR Application Team
CREATE SYNONYM emp_data FOR current_schema.employees;
```

#### **3. Consistent Usage Patterns**
```sql
-- Establish patterns for your organization
-- Pattern 1: Synonyms for cross-schema access
CREATE SYNONYM hr_employees FOR hr_schema.employees;
CREATE SYNONYM sales_orders FOR sales_schema.orders;

-- Pattern 2: Synonyms for environment independence
CREATE SYNONYM app_config FOR current_env.application_config;
CREATE SYNONYM app_logs FOR current_env.application_logs;
```

#### **4. Permission Management**
```sql
-- Grant permissions on underlying objects, not synonyms
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO app_user;
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;

-- App_user can now use the synonym
-- GRANT SELECT ON emp TO another_user;  -- This won't work
-- GRANT SELECT ON employees TO another_user;  -- This works
```

### Integration Best Practices

#### **1. Sequence + Trigger + Synonym Pattern**
```sql
-- Complete pattern for auto-incrementing IDs
-- 1. Create sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE customer_id_seq START WITH 1;

-- 2. Create synonym for sequence
CREATE SYNONYM next_cust_id FOR customer_id_seq;

-- 3. Create trigger for automatic assignment
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER customers_auto_id
    BEFORE INSERT ON customers
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.customer_id IS NULL THEN
        :NEW.customer_id := next_cust_id.NEXTVAL;
    END IF;
END;

-- 4. Application code is clean
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name) VALUES ('New Customer');
```

#### **2. Error Handling**
```sql
-- Handle synonym resolution errors
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION safe_synonym_access(
    synonym_name VARCHAR2
) RETURN NUMBER IS
    result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ' || synonym_name INTO result;
    RETURN result;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error accessing synonym: ' || synonym_name);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
        RETURN -1;
END;
```

#### **3. Migration Planning**
```sql
-- Plan for synonym changes during migrations
-- Step 1: Create new synonyms pointing to old objects
CREATE SYNONYM old_employees FOR legacy_schema.employees;

-- Step 2: Update application to use synonyms
-- (Application deployment)

-- Step 3: Create new schema and migrate data
-- (Data migration process)

-- Step 4: Switch synonyms to new objects
DROP SYNONYM old_employees;
CREATE SYNONYM old_employees FOR new_schema.employees;

-- Step 5: Rename synonyms to remove "old" prefix
DROP SYNONYM old_employees;
CREATE SYNONYM employees FOR new_schema.employees;
```

## Summary

Sequences and synonyms are fundamental Oracle objects that provide:

### **Sequences:**
- **Automatic Number Generation**: Reliable, unique, high-performance
- **Concurrency Support**: Multiple users can generate numbers simultaneously
- **Flexibility**: Configurable increment, start, max values, and caching
- **Gap Tolerance**: Understand that gaps are normal and acceptable

### **Synonyms:**
- **Location Transparency**: Hide physical object locations
- **Code Portability**: Same code works across environments
- **Security**: Control access through synonym permissions  
- **Simplification**: Easier names for complex object paths

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Use sequences for primary keys** - Much more efficient than MAX(ID)+1
2. **Cache sequences appropriately** - Balance performance vs gap tolerance
3. **Synonyms enable flexible architecture** - Easy to change underlying objects
4. **Plan for migrations** - Synonyms make schema changes transparent
5. **Follow naming conventions** - Clear, consistent names improve maintainability

### Next Steps:

- Implement sequences for all auto-incrementing columns
- Create synonyms for cross-schema object access
- Design migration strategies using synonyms
- Monitor sequence performance and usage

**Practice File**: Work through `src/advanced/sequences-synonyms.sql` for hands-on examples and exercises.
