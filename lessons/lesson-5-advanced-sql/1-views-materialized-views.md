## Understanding Views

### What is a View?

A **view** is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SELECT statement. Views don't store data themselves; they dynamically retrieve data from underlying tables when queried.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Virtual Table**: No physical storage of data
- **Dynamic**: Always shows current data from base tables
- **Simplified Access**: Hide complex queries behind simple interfaces
- **Security Layer**: Control access to sensitive data
- **Data Abstraction**: Present data in different formats

### Types of Views

#### 1. Simple Views
- Based on a single table
- No functions or calculations
- Usually updatable

#### 2. Complex Views
- Based on multiple tables
- May include JOINs, functions, GROUP BY
- Usually read-only

#### 3. Materialized Views
- Physical storage of query results
- Refreshed periodically or on-demand
- Significant performance benefits

### Benefits of Using Views

#### **Data Security**
```sql
-- Hide sensitive salary information
CREATE VIEW employee_public_info AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, department_id
FROM employees;
-- Salary column is not exposed
```

#### **Query Simplification**
```sql
-- Complex query simplified into a view
CREATE VIEW employee_department_summary AS
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    COUNT(e.employee_id) as employee_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e.salary), 2) as avg_salary,
    MIN(e.hire_date) as oldest_hire_date
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name;

-- Now users can simply query:
SELECT * FROM employee_department_summary;
```

#### **Data Abstraction**
```sql
-- Present data in business-friendly format
CREATE VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as sales_month,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY sales_month;
```

## Creating Simple Views

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[WITH CHECK OPTION]
[WITH READ ONLY];
```

### Simple View Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Employee View
```sql
-- Create a simple view showing active employees
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date <= SYSDATE;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM active_employees WHERE department_id = 20;
```

#### Example 2: Filtered Product View
```sql
-- View showing only products in stock
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW products_in_stock AS
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, unit_price
FROM sales.products
WHERE units_in_stock > 0
WITH READ ONLY;
```

#### Example 3: Renamed Column View
```sql
-- View with user-friendly column names
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_list AS
SELECT 
    customer_id as "Customer ID",
    customer_name as "Customer Name", 
    city as "City",
    country as "Country",
    phone as "Phone Number"
FROM sales.customers
ORDER BY customer_name;
```

### View Metadata

```sql
-- Check view definition
SELECT text FROM user_views WHERE view_name = 'ACTIVE_EMPLOYEES';

-- List all views owned by current user
SELECT view_name, text FROM user_views ORDER BY view_name;

-- Check view columns
SELECT column_name, data_type, nullable 
FROM user_tab_columns 
WHERE table_name = 'ACTIVE_EMPLOYEES';
```

---

## Complex Views

Complex views involve multiple tables, functions, and advanced SQL features.

### Multi-Table Views

#### Example 1: Employee Department View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as full_name,
    e.email,
    e.hire_date,
    e.salary,
    d.department_name,
    l.city || ', ' || l.country as location,
    j.job_title,
    m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name as manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
LEFT JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

#### Example 2: Sales Analysis View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW sales_analysis AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    c.city,
    c.country,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    MIN(o.order_date) as first_order,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_spent,
    ROUND(AVG(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price), 2) as avg_order_value,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) DESC) as customer_rank
FROM sales.customers c
LEFT JOIN sales.orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.city, c.country;
```

### Views with Calculations

#### Example 3: Employee Performance Metrics
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_performance AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as employee_name,
    e.hire_date,
    MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, e.hire_date) as tenure_months,
    e.salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, e.hire_date) < 12 THEN 'New Employee'
        WHEN MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, e.hire_date) < 60 THEN 'Experienced'
        ELSE 'Veteran'
    END as experience_level,
    ROUND((e.salary / dept_avg.avg_salary) * 100, 2) as salary_vs_dept_avg,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.commission_pct IS NOT NULL THEN 'Commission'
        ELSE 'Salary Only'
    END as compensation_type
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) dept_avg ON e.department_id = dept_avg.department_id;
```

### Hierarchical Views

#### Example 4: Organizational Hierarchy
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW org_hierarchy AS
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name || ' ' || last_name as employee_name,
    manager_id,
    LEVEL as hierarchy_level,
    SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(first_name || ' ' || last_name, ' -> ') as hierarchy_path,
    CONNECT_BY_ROOT (first_name || ' ' || last_name) as top_manager
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name, first_name;
```

## Updatable Views

Not all views can be updated. Oracle has specific rules for when a view is updatable.

### Rules for Updatable Views

A view is updatable if:
1. **Single Table**: Based on a single table
2. **No Aggregate Functions**: No GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT
3. **No Set Operations**: No UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS
4. **No Subqueries**: In SELECT or WHERE clauses
5. **All Required Columns**: All NOT NULL columns are included

### Example: Updatable Employee View

```sql
-- Create an updatable view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dept_20_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, salary, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 20
WITH CHECK OPTION;

-- This will work - INSERT
INSERT INTO dept_20_employees 
VALUES (999, 'John', 'Doe', 'jdoe@company.com', 5000, 20);

-- This will work - UPDATE
UPDATE dept_20_employees 
SET salary = 5500 
WHERE employee_id = 999;

-- This will fail due to CHECK OPTION
UPDATE dept_20_employees 
SET department_id = 30 
WHERE employee_id = 999;
-- Error: view WITH CHECK OPTION where-clause violation

-- This will work - DELETE
DELETE FROM dept_20_employees WHERE employee_id = 999;
```

### WITH CHECK OPTION

Ensures that INSERT and UPDATE operations satisfy the view's WHERE clause:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 10000
WITH CHECK OPTION;

-- This will fail
INSERT INTO high_salary_employees 
VALUES (998, 'Jane', 'Smith', 8000, 20);
-- Error: CHECK OPTION constraint violated
```

### INSTEAD OF Triggers for Complex Views

For complex views that aren't naturally updatable:

```sql
-- Create a complex view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_department_view AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.salary,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- Create INSTEAD OF trigger for updates
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER employee_dept_update_trigger
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON employee_department_view
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees
    SET first_name = :NEW.first_name,
        last_name = :NEW.last_name,
        salary = :NEW.salary
    WHERE employee_id = :NEW.employee_id;
END;
```

## Materialized Views

Materialized views physically store the result set, providing significant performance benefits for complex queries.

### Creating Materialized Views

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name
[BUILD IMMEDIATE | BUILD DEFERRED]
[REFRESH FAST | COMPLETE | FORCE]
[ON DEMAND | ON COMMIT]
[ENABLE | DISABLE QUERY REWRITE]
AS
SELECT ...;
```

#### Example 1: Basic Materialized View
```sql
-- Create materialized view for monthly sales summary
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_sales
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH COMPLETE ON DEMAND
AS
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as sales_month,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as avg_order_value
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM');

-- Query the materialized view (very fast)
SELECT * FROM mv_monthly_sales ORDER BY sales_month;
```

#### Example 2: Product Performance Materialized View
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_product_performance
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH COMPLETE ON DEMAND
ENABLE QUERY REWRITE
AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category_id,
    COUNT(oi.order_id) as times_ordered,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.unit_price) as avg_selling_price,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date
FROM sales.products p
LEFT JOIN sales.order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN sales.orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category_id;
```

### Refresh Options

#### ON DEMAND Refresh
```sql
-- Manual refresh
EXEC DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('MV_MONTHLY_SALES', 'C');

-- Refresh multiple materialized views
EXEC DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS();
```

#### ON COMMIT Refresh (for fast refresh)
```sql
-- Create materialized view log for fast refresh
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON sales.orders;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON sales.order_items;

-- Create fast refresh materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_daily_sales
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT
AS
SELECT 
    TRUNC(o.order_date) as order_date,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as daily_revenue
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY TRUNC(o.order_date);
```

### Materialized View Management

```sql
-- Check materialized view status
SELECT mview_name, refresh_mode, refresh_method, last_refresh_date
FROM user_mviews;

-- Check refresh history
SELECT mview_name, refresh_date, refresh_method 
FROM user_mview_refresh_times
ORDER BY refresh_date DESC;

-- Drop materialized view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_sales;
```

---

## View Security

Views are powerful tools for implementing database security by controlling data access.

### Column-Level Security

```sql
-- Hide sensitive employee data
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_public AS
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    hire_date,
    department_id
    -- salary, ssn, and other sensitive fields excluded
FROM employees;

-- Grant access to the view instead of the table
GRANT SELECT ON employee_public TO hr_users;
```

### Row-Level Security

```sql
-- Department managers can only see their department's employees
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW manager_employee_view AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.salary,
    e.department_id
FROM employees e
WHERE e.department_id = (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE employee_id = USER  -- Assuming USER contains employee_id
    AND job_id LIKE '%MANAGER%'
);
```

### Application Context Security

```sql
-- Using application context for dynamic security
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW secure_employee_view AS
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN SYS_CONTEXT('HR_CONTEXT', 'ROLE') = 'MANAGER' THEN salary
        ELSE NULL
    END as salary,
    department_id
FROM employees;
```

## Performance Considerations

### When to Use Views

#### **Good Use Cases:**
- **Frequently Used Complex Queries**: Save development time
- **Data Security**: Control access to sensitive information  
- **Data Abstraction**: Hide complexity from end users
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent business logic

#### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Simple Views**: Minimal performance impact
- **Complex Views**: May impact performance, consider materialized views
- **Nested Views**: Avoid views based on other views (performance killer)

### View Performance Tips

#### 1. Use Indexes on Base Tables
```sql
-- Ensure base tables have appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_dept_salary ON employees(department_id, salary);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON sales.orders(customer_id, order_date);
```

#### 2. Avoid SELECT *
```sql
-- BAD: Uses all columns
CREATE VIEW all_employee_data AS
SELECT * FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- GOOD: Only necessary columns
CREATE VIEW employee_summary AS
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

#### 3. Consider Materialized Views for Heavy Aggregations
```sql
-- Heavy aggregation - good candidate for materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary_mv AS
SELECT 
    p.category_id,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) as sales_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) as sales_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as customers,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as revenue
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN sales.order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id  
JOIN sales.products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date);
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions

```sql
-- Use clear, descriptive names
CREATE VIEW vw_employee_department_summary AS ...     -- Good
CREATE VIEW emp_dept AS ...                           -- Poor

-- Prefix materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_sales AS ...      -- Good
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS ...         -- Unclear
```

### 2. Documentation

```sql
-- Document complex views with comments
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_performance_metrics AS
-- Purpose: Provides comprehensive employee performance analysis
-- Created: 2025-01-15
-- Author: HR Analytics Team
-- Dependencies: employees, departments, jobs tables
-- Refresh: Real-time (regular view)
-- Notes: Includes tenure calculation and salary ranking
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    -- ... rest of query
```

### 3. Error Handling

```sql
-- Handle potential NULL values
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW safe_employee_metrics AS
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    COALESCE(salary, 0) as salary,
    COALESCE(commission_pct, 0) as commission_pct,
    ROUND(COALESCE(salary, 0) * (1 + COALESCE(commission_pct, 0)), 2) as total_compensation
FROM employees;
```

### 4. Testing and Validation

```sql
-- Test view performance
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM employee_department_summary;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);

-- Validate view results
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_department_summary;  -- Should match expectations
SELECT MAX(salary), MIN(salary) FROM employee_department_summary;  -- Check ranges
```

### 5. Maintenance

```sql
-- Regular maintenance tasks
-- 1. Monitor view usage
SELECT view_name, num_rows FROM user_tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'VW_%';

-- 2. Update materialized views
EXEC DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS();

-- 3. Check for invalid views
SELECT object_name, status FROM user_objects WHERE object_type = 'VIEW' AND status = 'INVALID';

-- 4. Recompile invalid views
ALTER VIEW invalid_view_name COMPILE;
```
