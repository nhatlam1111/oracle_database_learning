# Advanced Joins in Oracle Database

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will understand:
- CROSS JOINs and Cartesian products
- NATURAL JOINs and their implications
- Self-joins for hierarchical data
- Multiple table joins with complex conditions
- Anti-joins and semi-joins
- Advanced join optimization techniques

## Advanced Join Types

### 1. CROSS JOIN (Cartesian Product)

A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;

-- Alternative syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table1, table2;
```

**Use Cases:**
- Generating all possible combinations
- Creating test data sets
- Mathematical calculations requiring all permutations
- Calendar/schedule generation

**Example: Product-Size Combinations**
```sql
-- Generate all possible product-size combinations
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    s.size_name,
    p.base_price * s.price_multiplier AS final_price
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN product_sizes s
ORDER BY p.product_name, s.size_order;
```

**Warning:** CROSS JOINs can produce very large result sets. A table with 1000 rows CROSS JOINed with another 1000-row table produces 1,000,000 rows!

### 2. NATURAL JOIN

A NATURAL JOIN automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name and data type. Oracle automatically determines the join condition.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- If both tables have DEPARTMENT_ID column
SELECT employee_id, first_name, department_name
FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments;

-- Equivalent to:
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Cautions with NATURAL JOIN:**
- Less explicit than explicit JOIN conditions
- Can break if table structures change
- May join on unintended columns
- Generally not recommended for production code

### 3. USING Clause

The USING clause specifies which columns to join on when they have the same name in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 JOIN table2 USING (column_name);
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Join using specific column
SELECT employee_id, first_name, department_name
FROM employees JOIN departments USING (department_id);

-- Multiple columns
SELECT *
FROM employees JOIN job_history USING (employee_id, job_id);
```

## Self-Joins

Self-joins allow you to join a table with itself, useful for hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.

### Employee-Manager Hierarchy
```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
    e.job_id AS employee_job,
    m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name AS manager_name,
    m.job_id AS manager_job
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

### Finding Hierarchical Levels
```sql
-- Employee hierarchy with levels
WITH emp_hierarchy AS (
    -- Top level managers (no manager)
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name,
        manager_id,
        1 AS level,
        CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR2(4000)) AS path
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive part
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name,
        e.manager_id,
        eh.level + 1,
        eh.path || '/' || e.employee_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN emp_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT 
    LPAD(' ', (level - 1) * 4) || name AS hierarchy_display,
    level,
    path
FROM emp_hierarchy
ORDER BY path;
```

### Comparing Rows Within Same Table
```sql
-- Find employees hired in the same year
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id AS emp1_id,
    e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name AS emp1_name,
    e2.employee_id AS emp2_id,
    e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name AS emp2_name,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e1.hire_date) AS hire_year
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e1.hire_date) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e2.hire_date)
WHERE e1.employee_id < e2.employee_id  -- Avoid duplicates
ORDER BY hire_year, e1.employee_id;
```

## Multiple Table Joins

### Complex Multi-Table Scenarios
```sql
-- Employee details with full location hierarchy
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
    j.job_title,
    d.department_name,
    l.city,
    c.country_name,
    r.region_name,
    e.salary,
    mgr.first_name || ' ' || mgr.last_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
JOIN countries c ON l.country_id = c.country_id
JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
LEFT JOIN employees mgr ON e.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
WHERE e.salary > 10000
ORDER BY r.region_name, c.country_name, l.city, d.department_name;
```

### Conditional Joins
```sql
-- Different join conditions based on data
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name,
    oi.quantity,
    CASE 
        WHEN o.order_date >= DATE '2024-01-01' THEN p.current_price
        ELSE ph.historical_price
    END AS effective_price
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
LEFT JOIN price_history ph ON p.product_id = ph.product_id 
    AND o.order_date BETWEEN ph.effective_start AND ph.effective_end
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC;
```

## Anti-Joins and Semi-Joins

### Anti-Join (NOT EXISTS / NOT IN)
Anti-joins find rows in one table that don't have matching rows in another table.

```sql
-- Customers who haven't placed orders (Anti-join with NOT EXISTS)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- Alternative with LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.email
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL;

-- Products never ordered
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category
FROM products p
WHERE p.product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT oi.product_id 
    FROM order_items oi 
    WHERE oi.product_id IS NOT NULL
);
```

### Semi-Join (EXISTS / IN)
Semi-joins find rows in one table that have matching rows in another table, but only return columns from the first table.

```sql
-- Customers who have placed orders (Semi-join with EXISTS)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.registration_date
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- Employees who have job history
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.hire_date
FROM employees e
WHERE e.employee_id IN (
    SELECT jh.employee_id 
    FROM job_history jh
);
```

## Advanced Join Optimization

### 1. Join Order Optimization
```sql
-- Oracle's optimizer usually handles this, but understanding helps
-- Join smaller tables first, then larger ones
-- Use hints when necessary (rarely needed)

-- Example: If departments is small, employees medium, locations large
SELECT /*+ ORDERED */ 
    d.department_name,
    e.first_name,
    l.city
FROM departments d,     -- Smallest table first
     employees e,       -- Medium table second  
     locations l        -- Largest table last
WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
  AND d.location_id = l.location_id;
```

### 2. Index Considerations for Joins
```sql
-- Ensure join columns are indexed
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_id ON employees(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_manager_id ON employees(manager_id);

-- Composite indexes for multi-column joins
CREATE INDEX idx_job_hist_emp_job ON job_history(employee_id, job_id);

-- Consider covering indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_covering ON employees(department_id, employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary);
```

### 3. Using Hash Joins for Large Data Sets
```sql
-- Hash joins are efficient for large tables with good selectivity
SELECT /*+ USE_HASH(e d) */ 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000;
```

## Common Advanced Patterns

### 1. Latest Record Per Group
```sql
-- Latest order for each customer
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS latest_order_date
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) latest ON c.customer_id = latest.customer_id
JOIN orders o ON latest.customer_id = o.customer_id 
    AND latest.latest_order_date = o.order_date;

-- Using window functions (more elegant)
WITH ranked_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        o.*,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM orders o
)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, ro.order_date, ro.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN ranked_orders ro ON c.customer_id = ro.customer_id
WHERE ro.rn = 1;
```

### 2. Pivot-like Operations with Joins
```sql
-- Sales by quarter using joins
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 1 THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 2 THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS q2_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 3 THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS q3_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 4 THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS q4_sales
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE '2024-01-01' OR o.order_date IS NULL
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY p.product_name;
```

### 3. Recursive Joins (Connect By Prior)
```sql
-- Oracle-specific hierarchical query
SELECT 
    LEVEL,
    LPAD(' ', (LEVEL - 1) * 4) || first_name || ' ' || last_name AS hierarchy,
    employee_id,
    manager_id,
    job_id
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL  -- Top-level managers
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id  -- Recursive relationship
ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name;

-- Path from root
SELECT 
    LEVEL,
    SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(first_name || ' ' || last_name, ' -> ') AS path,
    employee_id
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```

## Performance Monitoring and Tuning

### 1. Execution Plan Analysis
```sql
-- Explain plan for complex join
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name, l.city
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000;

-- View execution plan
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);
```

### 2. Join Statistics
```sql
-- Analyze join performance
SELECT 
    operation,
    options,
    object_name,
    cost,
    cardinality,
    access_predicates,
    filter_predicates
FROM v$sql_plan
WHERE sql_id = '&sql_id'
ORDER BY id;
```

## Best Practices for Advanced Joins

### 1. Code Readability
- Use meaningful table aliases
- Align JOIN conditions for readability
- Comment complex join logic
- Break complex queries into CTEs when possible

### 2. Performance Guidelines
- Join on indexed columns when possible
- Filter early in the query process
- Use appropriate join types for your needs
- Monitor and analyze execution plans

### 3. Maintainability
- Avoid overly complex joins when simpler alternatives exist
- Document business logic behind complex joins
- Use views to encapsulate frequently used join patterns
- Test join performance with realistic data volumes

## Common Advanced Join Mistakes

### 1. Unnecessary Cartesian Products
```sql
-- WRONG: Missing join condition
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.salary > 50000;

-- CORRECT: Include proper join condition
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000;
```

### 2. Self-Join Confusion
```sql
-- WRONG: Same alias for self-join
SELECT e.first_name, e.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees e ON e.manager_id = e.employee_id;

-- CORRECT: Different aliases
SELECT e.first_name, m.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

### 3. Performance Anti-Patterns
```sql
-- WRONG: Function in join condition
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON UPPER(e.department_name) = UPPER(d.department_name);

-- CORRECT: Function-based index or data cleanup
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_name_upper ON departments(UPPER(department_name));
-- Or fix data quality issues
```
