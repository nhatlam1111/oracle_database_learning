## Relational Database Principles

### What Makes a Database "Relational"?

A relational database is based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables (relations) that can be linked—or related—based on data common to each. Key principles include:

1. **Tables**: Data is stored in tables with rows (records) and columns (attributes)
2. **Relationships**: Tables are connected through common data elements
3. **Normalization**: Data is organized to reduce redundancy and dependency
4. **Integrity**: Rules ensure data accuracy and consistency

### Benefits of Relational Design

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents inconsistent or invalid data
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Information stored once, referenced everywhere
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify structure without affecting applications
- **Scalability**: Efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets
- **Security**: Fine-grained access control at table and column levels

## Types of Relationships

### 1. One-to-Many (1:M) Relationship

The most common relationship type where one record in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B.

**Example**: One department can have many employees
```
DEPARTMENTS (1) ←→ (Many) EMPLOYEES
```

**Business Logic**:
- Each employee belongs to exactly one department
- Each department can have zero or more employees
- The foreign key is stored in the "many" side (EMPLOYEES table)

### 2. Many-to-Many (M:M) Relationship

A relationship where multiple records in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B.

**Example**: Products and Orders
```
PRODUCTS (Many) ←→ (Many) ORDERS
```

**Implementation**: Requires a junction/bridge table
```
PRODUCTS (1) ←→ (Many) ORDER_ITEMS (Many) ←→ (1) ORDERS
```

**Business Logic**:
- Each order can contain multiple products
- Each product can appear in multiple orders
- The ORDER_ITEMS table stores the relationship plus additional data (quantity, price)

### 3. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship

A relationship where one record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B.

**Example**: Employee and Employee_Details
```
EMPLOYEES (1) ←→ (1) EMPLOYEE_DETAILS
```

**Business Logic**:
- Each employee has exactly one detailed profile
- Each profile belongs to exactly one employee
- Often used for security or performance reasons (sensitive data separation)

### 4. Self-Referencing Relationship

A table that relates to itself, typically used for hierarchical data.

**Example**: Employee management hierarchy
```
EMPLOYEES (Manager) ←→ (Employee) EMPLOYEES
```

**Business Logic**:
- Each employee can have one manager (who is also an employee)
- Each manager can supervise multiple employees

## Primary and Foreign Keys

### Primary Keys

A primary key is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.

**Characteristics**:
- Must be unique for each row
- Cannot contain NULL values
- Should not change once assigned
- Should be as simple as possible

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Single column primary key
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Composite primary key
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id NUMBER,
    product_id NUMBER,
    quantity NUMBER,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```

### Foreign Keys

A foreign key is a column (or combination of columns) that refers to the primary key of another table.

**Characteristics**:
- Must match an existing primary key value in the referenced table
- Can be NULL (unless specified otherwise)
- Enforces referential integrity
- Can have multiple foreign keys in one table

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50),
    department_id NUMBER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept 
        FOREIGN KEY (department_id) 
        REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

## Referential Integrity

Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.

### Rules Enforced:

1. **Insert Rule**: Cannot insert a foreign key value that doesn't exist in the parent table
2. **Update Rule**: Cannot update a foreign key to a value that doesn't exist in the parent table
3. **Delete Rule**: Cannot delete a parent record if child records exist (by default)

### Cascade Options:

```sql
-- Cascade delete: Delete child records when parent is deleted
CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept 
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) 
    REFERENCES departments(department_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Set null: Set foreign key to NULL when parent is deleted
CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept 
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) 
    REFERENCES departments(department_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
```

## Introduction to JOINs

### What is a JOIN?

A JOIN is a SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

### Basic JOIN Syntax

```sql
-- ANSI Standard Syntax (Recommended)
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

-- Oracle Traditional Syntax (Legacy)
SELECT columns
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.column = table2.column;
```

### Why Use JOINs?

1. **Combine Related Data**: Get complete information from normalized tables
2. **Avoid Data Duplication**: Keep data in appropriate tables
3. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Leverage foreign key relationships
4. **Flexible Reporting**: Create views combining multiple data sources

### JOIN Types Overview

| Join Type | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| INNER JOIN | Returns only matching records | When you need data that exists in both tables |
| LEFT OUTER JOIN | Returns all left table records + matches | When you need all records from the left table |
| RIGHT OUTER JOIN | Returns all right table records + matches | When you need all records from the right table |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | Returns all records from both tables | When you need all records regardless of matches |
| CROSS JOIN | Cartesian product of both tables | For creating combinations or test data |
| SELF JOIN | Table joined with itself | For hierarchical or comparative queries |

## Sample Schema Relationships

### HR Schema Entity Relationship Diagram

```
COUNTRIES
    ↓ (1:M)
LOCATIONS
    ↓ (1:M)
DEPARTMENTS
    ↓ (1:M)
EMPLOYEES → JOBS (M:1)
    ↓ (self-reference)
EMPLOYEES (manager_id)
```

### Detailed HR Relationships:

1. **EMPLOYEES ↔ DEPARTMENTS**: Each employee belongs to one department
2. **EMPLOYEES ↔ JOBS**: Each employee has one job title
3. **EMPLOYEES ↔ EMPLOYEES**: Each employee may have one manager
4. **DEPARTMENTS ↔ LOCATIONS**: Each department is in one location
5. **LOCATIONS ↔ COUNTRIES**: Each location is in one country

### SALES Schema Entity Relationship Diagram

```
CUSTOMERS
    ↓ (1:M)
ORDERS
    ↓ (1:M)
ORDER_ITEMS → PRODUCTS (M:1)
```

### Detailed SALES Relationships:

1. **CUSTOMERS ↔ ORDERS**: Each customer can have multiple orders
2. **ORDERS ↔ ORDER_ITEMS**: Each order can have multiple line items
3. **PRODUCTS ↔ ORDER_ITEMS**: Each product can appear in multiple orders

## Common Relationship Patterns

### 1. Lookup Tables

Tables that store reference data used by other tables.

```sql
-- Countries table (lookup)
CREATE TABLE countries (
    country_id CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    country_name VARCHAR2(40)
);

-- Locations table (uses country lookup)
CREATE TABLE locations (
    location_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    street_address VARCHAR2(40),
    city VARCHAR2(30),
    country_id CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES countries(country_id)
);
```

### 2. Bridge/Junction Tables

Tables that resolve many-to-many relationships.

```sql
-- Many-to-many between orders and products
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id NUMBER,
    product_id NUMBER,
    quantity NUMBER,
    unit_price NUMBER,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

### 3. Hierarchical Tables

Tables that reference themselves for tree structures.

```sql
-- Employee hierarchy
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(20),
    last_name VARCHAR2(25),
    manager_id NUMBER,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);
```

## Best Practices for Relationships

### 1. Naming Conventions

- Use consistent naming for primary and foreign keys
- Foreign key names should indicate the referenced table
- Use meaningful constraint names

```sql
-- Good naming
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id NUMBER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_emp_dept FOREIGN KEY (department_id) 
        REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

### 2. Indexing Foreign Keys

Always create indexes on foreign key columns for better JOIN performance.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_id ON employees(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_manager_id ON employees(manager_id);
```

### 3. Avoid Circular References

Design relationships to prevent circular dependencies.

```sql
-- Avoid: A references B, B references C, C references A
-- Instead: Use hierarchical or one-way relationships
```

### 4. Consider Relationship Cardinality

Design tables based on actual business requirements.

```sql
-- If a customer can have multiple addresses
CREATE TABLE customer_addresses (
    customer_id NUMBER,
    address_type VARCHAR2(10), -- 'HOME', 'WORK', 'BILLING'
    street_address VARCHAR2(100),
    -- ...
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, address_type)
);
```

## Understanding Query Execution

### How JOINs Work Internally

1. **Table Access**: Database accesses the required tables
2. **Join Condition Evaluation**: Compares values based on join condition
3. **Result Set Construction**: Combines matching rows
4. **Filtering**: Applies WHERE clause conditions
5. **Sorting**: Applies ORDER BY if specified

### Join Algorithms

- **Nested Loop Join**: Good for small tables or when one table is much smaller
- **Hash Join**: Efficient for large tables with equality conditions
- **Sort-Merge Join**: Good for sorted data or inequality conditions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Cartesian Products

```sql
-- Problem: Missing join condition
SELECT * FROM employees, departments;

-- Solution: Add proper join condition
SELECT * FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 2. Unexpected Result Counts

```sql
-- Problem: Duplicate rows due to one-to-many relationship
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- If you need unique employees, consider what you're actually trying to achieve
```

### 3. NULL Handling in Relationships

```sql
-- Employees without departments won't appear in INNER JOIN
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
